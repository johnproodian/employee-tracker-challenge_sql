# Employee Tracker (SQL) 

This application is a content management system that allows users to manage a company's employee database.

## Usage
See my walkthrough [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKlquC55rEU4oDeYHDDA7-DOJVwrPkl_/view) to run the application on the command line.

It should look something like this:
